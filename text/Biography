Beatriz Lerer Castelo was born in 1999 in Lisbon and moved to Amsterdam in 2017 to start her Recorder Bachelor Studies at the Conservatorium van Amsterdam, in the class of Jorge Isaac. In the last three years she has had somewhat regular lessons with distinguished players such as Erik Bosgraaf, Kees Boeke and Michael Form.
Her musical practice is versatile, ranging from Renaissance and Baroque to Contemporary, both in solo and chamber settings, and occasionally with electronics. During 2018 and 2019 she was part of the Five Spice recorder quintet, with which she performed both in the Netherlands and in Germany. She has also performed on multiple occasions with the Royal Wind Music Academy, under the guidance of Hester Groenleer and María Martínez Ayerza.
Composing and arranging are also interests of hers and one of the biggest influences is traditional music, which she tries to explore and incorporate into her practice as much as possible.
Concurrently to her musical path she is active as a photographer and very interested and open to any art form or opportunity that stimulates and feeds her creativity.
