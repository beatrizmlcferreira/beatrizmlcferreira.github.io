The 2020-2021 project “Gesture within a Frame” with Teresa Costa is the first multidisciplinary project Beatriz had full (shared) creative responsibility over. It is a partnership between the different languages in which the artists express themselves. This resulted in a collaboration which aims to create new music inspired by graphic elements taken from black and white photographs that reflect the principle of body respect.
Teresa and Beatriz contacted the models, took the photographs, analysed them and in some cases added an additional layer (collage, acrylic, sewing, etc). They then used this visual result as a departing point to create music. An essential common trait of all pieces is the space left for deliberate indeterminacy. All pieces have a backbone - an inner structure and concrete colour and atmosphere - but they are open concepts, intentionally transient: the possibilities are infinite.
In this video you can hear a ten minute sample of the resulting music with a little animation over the original images - its intention is to enhance both artistic expressions by establishing this relationship, since the pictures inspired the music which later inspired their presentation and animation. The circle is then closed.
